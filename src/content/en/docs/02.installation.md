title: "Installation"

Right now you install by cloning the repo. An npm package is planned but not available yet.

### Clone (current path)
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apleasantview/eleventy-baseline.git my-site
   cd my-site
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run Eleventy in server mode:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Degit (optional)
If you prefer a copy without git history:
```bash
npx degit apleasantview/eleventy-baseline my-site
cd my-site
npm install
npm start
```

### NPM package (planned)
The goal is to offer `npm install eleventy-baseline` in the future. Until then, use clone or degit.

> Status: experimental. Scripts, paths, and APIs may change.

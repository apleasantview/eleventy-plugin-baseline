title: "navigator-context"

> Note: The options API is still evolving; expect tweaks as the project grows.

## What it does
- Adds a Nunjucks global `_context` that returns the underlying Eleventy render context (`this.ctx`).
- Useful for debugging or inspecting data at render time without the extra navigator page.

### Defaults
- No custom options.

### How it works
- Registers `_context()` to return `this.ctx` when called in Nunjucks.

### Tips
- Use `_context()` in templates to quickly inspect available data during development.
- Pair with `_navigator()` (from navigator-core) when you need a fuller view of the render context.

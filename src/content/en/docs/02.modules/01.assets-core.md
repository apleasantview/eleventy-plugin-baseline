## What it does
- Creates a virtual `assets` directory in Eleventy.
- Resolves assets input/output directories and exposes them via `_baseline.assets`.
- Adds a watch target under the resolved assets directory.

## Defaults
- Assets live under `src/assets/` (via Eleventy dir settings).
- Virtual dir key: fixed to `assets` (adds `directories.assets` if not already defined).
- Respects Baseline `verbose` flag for logging.

## Options
- None. Inherits global Baseline `verbose`.

## How it works
- On `eleventy.directories`, resolves input/output/assets paths and defines `directories.assets`.
- Exposes global data at `_baseline.assets` with `input` and `output`.
- Adds a watch target under the resolved assets directory (`**/*.{css,js,svg,png,jpeg}`).

## Tips
- Keep assets in `src/assets/` to match the defaults.
- Pair with the PostCSS/esbuild modules for processing `src/assets/css/index.css` and `src/assets/js/index.js`.

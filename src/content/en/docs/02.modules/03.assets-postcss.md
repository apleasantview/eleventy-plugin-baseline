> Note: The options API is still evolving; expect tweaks as the project grows.

## What it does
- Adds `css` as a template format and processes `src/assets/css/index.css`.
- Runs PostCSS with your shared `postcss.config.js` (import, nesting/preset-env, cssnano in prod).
- Outputs compiled CSS for Eleventy to write to `dist`.

### Defaults
- Entry: `./src/assets/css/index.css` only.
- Uses `postcss.config.js` (respects source maps per config, minifies in production via cssnano).
- No layouts for CSS.
- No custom options yet (inherits global Baseline `verbose` for logging).

### How it works
- Registers `css` format and an extension handler that runs only for `index.css` under `src/assets/css/`.
- Runs PostCSS with configured plugins, returns `result.css`.
- Leaves non-entry CSS files untouched (they’ll fall through).

### Tips
- Keep your CSS entry at `src/assets/css/index.css` to match the current behavior.
- Use `inlinePostCSS` filter if you want to inline compiled CSS in templates.
- Additional entry points or plugin overrides would require extending this module (options to come).

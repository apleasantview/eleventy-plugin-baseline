## What it does
- Adds `js` as a template format and processes any `index.js` under the resolved assets `js` directory (from Eleventy `dir.assets`).
- Bundles with esbuild (target `es2020`), minifies, and outputs JS.
- Skips `11tydata.js` files and other JS outside the assets entry.
- Overrides the default `all` collection to exclude `11tydata.js`.
- Registers a filter `inlineESbuild` to inline and bundle arbitrary JS files.

## Defaults
- Entries: any `index.js` file under `<input>/<assets>/js/` (including nested folders).
- Bundle/minify with esbuild, target `es2020`.
- Options: none (inherits global Baseline `verbose` only).

## How it works
- Resolves the assets directory from Eleventy `dir` and builds `jsDir` from it.
- Registers `js` format and an extension handler that runs for `index.js` under the resolved assets `js` directory.
- Runs esbuild with `{ bundle: true, minify: true, write: false, target: "es2020" }`, returns compiled text.
- Replaces the default `all` collection with one that filters out `11tydata.js`.

## Inlining a bundle
- Any JS file can be inlined with `inlineESbuild`; the filter bundles the exact file you pass (not limited to assets dir).
- In a template or Markdown file, build the path (e.g., from `_baseline.assets.input`) and pipe it through `inlineESbuild`.  
- In Markdown, keep the call unindented and on its own lines so the `<script>` is treated as raw HTML.

Example:
```njk
{% raw %}{% set jsPath = _baseline.assets.input ~ "js/inline-example.js" %}
{{ jsPath | inlineESbuild | safe }}{% endraw %}
```

## Tips
- Any nested `index.js` under the assets `js` directory will be bundled; keep only the entries you intend to ship.
- Pair with `inlineESbuild` filter if you want to inline the bundled output in templates.

{% set assetsUrl = _baseline.assets.input ~ "js/inline-example.js" %}

{{ assetsUrl | inlineESbuild | safe }}

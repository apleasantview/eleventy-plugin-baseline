> Note: The options API is still evolving; expect tweaks as the project grows.

## What it does
- Adds `js` as a template format and processes `src/assets/js/index.js`.
- Bundles with esbuild (target `es2020`), minifies, and outputs JS.
- Skips `11tydata.js` files and other JS outside the assets entry.
- Overrides the default `all` collection to exclude `11tydata.js`.

### Defaults
- Entry: `./src/assets/js/index.js` only.
- Bundle/minify: on (esbuild, target `es2020`).
- Layouts: disabled for JS.
- Collection: `all` is filtered to drop `11tydata.js`.
- No custom options yet (inherits global Baseline `verbose` for logging).

### How it works
- Registers `js` format and an extension handler that runs only for `index.js` under `src/assets/js/`.
- Runs esbuild with `bundle: true`, `minify: true`, `write: false`, returns compiled text.
- Replaces the default `all` collection with one that filters out `11tydata.js`.

### Tips
- Keep your JS entry at `src/assets/js/index.js` to match the current behavior.
- Pair with `inlineESbuild` filter if you want to inline the bundled output in templates.
- If you need multiple entry points or config overrides, you’ll extend this module (options to come).

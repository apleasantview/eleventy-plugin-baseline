Eleventy Baseline is an experimental, optional toolkit for Eleventy. It bundles the little pieces you tend to wire on every project—assets, head/meta, images, debugging, and sitemap—without turning into a framework.

Work in progress: APIs and defaults may shift as this project evolves.

## What this includes today
- Assets: PostCSS (`index.css` entries), esbuild (`index.js` entries), image shortcode (`eleventy-img`), inline filters for CSS/JS.
- Head: `<baseline-head>` → merged head/meta (canonical, robots, OG/Twitter shells) from site/page + `_data/head.js`.
- Debug: `_navigator`, `_context`, `_inspect`, `_json`, `_keys`; optional navigator page when enabled.
- Sitemap: `/sitemap.xml` generated by default; per-page `sitemap` controls.
- Globals: `date.toUTCISO` for sitemap `lastmod`.

## Who it’s for
- You already use Eleventy and want common niceties prewired but stay in control.
- You’re curious about Eleventy but prefer vanilla, with a few conveniences.
- You like the idea of a minimal “starter core” rather than a theme.

## Current state
- Status: experimental; APIs and structure can shift.
- Package name set (`eleventy-plugin-baseline`); install path may change when published—today you clone/degit.
- i18n and deeper SEO (JSON-LD) are planned but not yet wired.

## What’s next
- Iterative SEO features (JSON-LD presets, stronger defaults).
- i18n wiring.
- More examples as features settle.

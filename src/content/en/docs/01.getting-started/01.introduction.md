Eleventy Baseline is an experimental, lightweight toolkit for Eleventy — a small set of prewired helpers meant to cut down on repetitive setup without turning into a framework or theme.

## What it is
- A “Swiss army knife” of practical defaults: filters/shortcodes, assets pipeline (PostCSS + esbuild), image shortcode, head/meta injection, debugging helpers.
- Comes with sensible wiring out of the box:  
  - Filters: `markdownify`, `relatedPosts`, `inlinePostCSS`, `inlineESbuild`, `isString`, `inspect`, `json`, `keys`  
  - Shortcode: `image` (eleventy-img)  
  - Plugins: assets (PostCSS, esbuild, eleventy-img), navigator helpers, head/meta injection, syntax highlight, HTML base  
  - Passthrough: `src/static` → `/`  
  - Watch: `src/assets/**/*.{css,js,svg,png,jpeg}`
- Optional by design: stays close to core Eleventy and keeps templating in your hands.
- Evolving: pieces may change as the project grows.

## Who it’s for
- You already use Eleventy and want common niceties prewired.
- You’re curious about Eleventy but prefer vanilla, with a few conveniences.
- You like the idea of a minimal “baseline” layer without adding a framework.

## Current state
- Status: experimental/playground; APIs and structure can shift.
- Head/meta: baseline-head injection with sensible defaults; more SEO work is planned.
- i18n: groundwork exists but is not wired in yet.
- No npm package yet — today you clone and run locally.

## What to expect next
- Iterative SEO features (canonical defaults, JSON-LD presets, sitemap).
- Better docs and examples as features settle.
- Styling and polish later; these docs focus on content first.

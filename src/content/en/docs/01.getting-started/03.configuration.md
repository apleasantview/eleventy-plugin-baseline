Eleventy Baseline is a plugin you load in your `eleventy.config.js`. It brings its own defaults but tries to keep room for your own config.

Right now, some wiring is opinionated/hard-wired (entrypoints, head tag, assets) while the project is still in its exploration phase; this is how it’s currently used day to day.

Additionally, the docs in `src` provide a good example of a standard config and site structure.

## Default configuration
This is what the current Baseline configuration looks like with defaults:
```js
import baseline from "./_baseline/eleventy.config.js";
import { config as _config } from "./_baseline/eleventy.config.js";

eleventyConfig.addPlugin(baseline({
  verbose: false,                    // don't show extra logs
  enableNavigatorTemplate: false,   // disable navigator template
}));

export const config = _config; // reuse Baseline’s dir/template defaults
```

### Extending your `eleventy.config.js` file
Add any filter. shortcode, plugin, collection, ... after the the Baseline plugin; just like any other Eleventy project.

Keep your own customizations in an `_extend` folder next to your input folder (or inside your input directory) and import them in `.eleventy.config.js` to simplify updates and keep your config file clean.

### Config object
Baseline exports the Eleventy configuration object, setting directories defaults and a default virtual directory for assets. It also sets the default templating engines to Nunjucks and specifies template formats.

Default config object:
```js
export const config = {
  dir: {
    input: "src",
    output: "dist",
    data: "_data",
    includes: "_includes",
    assets: "assets"
  },
  htmlTemplateEngine: "njk",
  markdownTemplateEngine: "njk",
  templateFormats: ["html", "njk", "md"]
};
```
### Customize the config object
If you ever need to override something in `_config`, you can do it inline at the end:
```js
export const config = {
  ..._config,
  dir: {
    ..._config.dir,
    output: "dist-site"
  }
};
```
That way you keep all baseline defaults and just extend them for your project. Alternatively, simply provide your own config object.

Work in progress: APIs and defaults may shift as this project evolves.
{% endalertBlock %}

## What this is
- An experimental, optional toolkit for Eleventy: assets pipeline (PostCSS, esbuild), head/meta injection, image shortcode, debug helpers, and sitemap.
- Eleventy-first: templating stays yours; this adds conveniences, not a framework.
- Evolving: i18n and deeper SEO (JSON-LD) are planned.

## Who it’s for
- Eleventy users who want common niceties prewired but stay in control.
- Curious newcomers who like vanilla Eleventy with a few batteries included.
- Anyone exploring a minimal “starter core” rather than a theme.

## Current pieces
- Assets: PostCSS (`index.css` entries), esbuild (`index.js` entries), image shortcode (`eleventy-img`), inline filters.
- Head: `<baseline-head>` → merged head/meta (canonical, robots, OG/Twitter shells) from site/page + `_data/head.js`.
- Debug: `_navigator`, `_context`, `_inspect`, `_json`, `_keys`; optional navigator page when enabled.
- Sitemap: `/sitemap.xml` generated by default, with per-page `sitemap` controls.
- Globals: `date.toUTCISO` for sitemap `lastmod`.

## Status and expectations
- Package name: `@apleasantview/eleventy-plugin-baseline` (install path may change when published).
- Options API is still evolving; modules may gain/lose switches.
- Docs aim to stay in sync with code; check module pages for specifics.
